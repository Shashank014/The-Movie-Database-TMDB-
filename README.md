🎬 Web Scraping Project: The Movie Database (TMDb)

📝 Problem Statement

Accessing and gathering relevant information from web pages is a common business requirement, especially when the data is distributed across multiple pages or websites. Manually collecting this data is time-consuming and inefficient. This project addresses this challenge by implementing a programmatic solution to extract, parse, and structure data from a selected website.

🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to extract movie-related data from The Movie Database (TMDb) across multiple pages and convert it into a structured tabular format. The extracted data includes information such as a movie's title, genre, cast, and user rating, enabling further analysis and insights.
